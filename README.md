# Data Manipulation with the Tidyverse
Tidyverse workshop for Northwestern Data Science and Programming Workshops Summer 2019

Instructor: [Katie Evans](kathryn.evans@u.northwestern.edu)

# What is the Tidyverse?
* Collection of packages for data manipulation, exploration, and visualization that share a common syntax
* Intended to make data scientists more productive by guiding them through workflows
* Allows for connections between tools

# Topics to cover
* **dplyr**: The dplyr package is the most useful package in R for data manipulation. One of the greatest advantages of the package is that you can use the pipe function (%>%) to combine different functions.
* **tidyr**: The tidyr package complements dplyr perfectly. It boosts the power of dplyr for data manipulation and pre-processing.
* **readr**: The readr package is used to import and export data as tibbles in R.

# Other Tidyverse packages to check out:
* **stringr**: The stringr package is used for strings. It provides a cohesive set of functions designed to make working with strings as easy as possible.
* **ggplot2**: Data scientists universally love using ggplot2 to produce their charts and visualizations!
* **lubridate**: The lubridate package is the best way to deal with dates and times in R! From converting strings to dates to calculating hours between two time points.
* **purrr**: The purrr package in R provides a complete toolkit for enhancing Râ€™s functional programming. We can use the functions provide by purrr to avoid many loops with just one line of code.
* **forecats**: The forecats package is dedicated to dealing with categorical variables or factors.
* **broom**: The broom package takes the messy output of built-in functions in R and turns them into tidy dataframes
